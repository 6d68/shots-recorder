# Shots Recorder

I bought IP cameras to observe my cats. I just didn't like the cloud connection and the access to the camera directly to view recordings (here triggered by motion) is also not very user-friendly. The recordings are in AVI format and therefore not directly viewable in the browser. 

This repo focuses on the back end part only.


A client application will be developed [here](https://github.com/6d68/shots-viewer) in the future.
