# Shots Recorder UI

Basic UI showing latest shots implemented with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
The user must be authenticated to see shots. Therefore Auth0 must be configured accordingly. See [.env.template](.env.template)
